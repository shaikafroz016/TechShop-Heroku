first go to front end and npm run build to build the frontend
It creates an optimized production build
Next we go to server js and if the env is in production mode then we set /frontend/build as our static folder
and then for all unknown routes we send index.html app.get('*') we send the file index.html

By doing this if we run only the backend part which is npm start
then on localhost:5000 we get our website (wow) w dont need to run front end part as we have done the build
