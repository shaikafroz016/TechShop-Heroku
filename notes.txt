redux flow to create new feature:
go to constants and create constants
next go to reducers and create reducer
then go to store and add the reducer in combine reducer
after all this we go to action to make a request to the backend
then go to the screen and call the action using useDispatch 
and useSelector to retrive data from the state and use inside the jsx


we dispatch action from screens
action goes to reducer
reducer have constants and action also have constants
constants are actually the action names
